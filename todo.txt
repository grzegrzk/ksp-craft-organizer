TODO:
 - Colorize current tags button according to save status
 - maybe tags should be saved in event onAboutToSaveShip?
 - Save tags to .craft file, see BetterCrewAssignment how they store data in crafts
	- Also see: onEditorPartEvent.PartRootSelected or onEditorPodSelected
 - Apply tags immediately when modified in current craft (if .craft file exists)
 - Available tags should be stored in main save file. How to do it?
	- See onGameStateSave/onGameStateLoad
 - All tags should be stored in single craft-manager.cache file. The cache should be updated basing on timestamp of the .craft file modification.
 
 
Done:
 - Avoid exceptions in Making History expansion
 - Take into account that there maybe replacement parts - vehicles with such parts should not be marked as unavailable
 - Localize stock craft names
 - Fix craft renaming: after rename window needs to be reopened + thumbnail is not renamed
 
 - Cache all craft data (not only the one used for filtering)
 - When file is renamed do not change timestamp of the file
 - add .version file
 - check assigment of tags to local craft and write comment how to test it in the future 
 - Add arrow with indication what is current sort order
 - check generation of preview pictures. Done: standard KSP do not generate it as well
 - Check situation when there is a craft with parts that are not available due to science level. Done: standard KSP allows to read craft without problems
 - Add possibility to read crafts from different save
 - Allow to collapse tags on the "manage tags" list
 - Change icons to the ones provided by cy4n
 - Add mouse over image
 - Allow to collapse tags on the filter list
 - Fix: list of crafts is not refreshed when craft is deleted
 - Fix "unsaved changes" dialog displayed when user has unmodified new craft
 - Fix bug with wrongly displayed tags in scenario: got to VAB -> open craft -> rename -> save -> assign new tags -> launch -> recover vessel -> go to VAB -> click "tags"
 - Fix bug with image sometimes displayed outside tooltip
 - Remember selected filter separately for VABinVAB/SPHinVAB/VABinSPH/SPHinSPH
 - Correct bug with tags not being saved in this scenario: open craft -> change name -> save -> go to different building using "go to" plugin
 - The tags selected in a single group should display crafts with any of the selected tags
 - Add tooltip that will show big thumbnail, name and description
 - Add double-click to load
 - Correct bug: select "all" in "-Archived?", click cancel, open window. The filter returns to default
 - Correct the way how min width is computed if there is gui scaling
 - Correct bug: open ships with tags -> change name (no save !) -> launch -> revert -> save. Bug: tags are not saved
 - Add icons to toolbar
 - Add darker background when windows are displayed
 - Remove "Edit" skin from manage window
 - Remember skin between editor opens
 - Check if parts used in craft are available due to science
 - Add performance logs while loading crafts
 - Hide tags filtering if no craft has assigned tag & display only used tags
 - Focus text search window when window is opened
 - Solve problem with strange height of some scroll windows
 - Lock editor when managing tags
 - Add "new tag" field to the window with tags for current craft
 - Add Delete button
 - Make all windows inherit from common class
 - Show warning when craft is going to be loaded and current craft is unsaved
 - Allow to discard changes made in tags
 - Refactor script.cs, introduce Debug & Release versions
 - change everything except MonBehavior to camelCase
 - Draw tags as categories in craft list
 - Introduce plugin settings: it will have "Debug" option + default available tags
 - Save tags for stock crafts inside save folder instead of shared folder
 - When editor is locked the "close" should be locked as well
 - add "Status\Archived" to default tags, change the prefix "Building Stage\" to "Status\"
 - In "Filter" window show tags in categories. In each category add special filtering option <with no tag from this category>
 - make changes to make it possible to have "archived" tag that will be quite natural to use
 - Load craft lazily - first load metadata if it exists (it should contain the craft name as well), then filter the crafts
 	and lastly load full craft's data only if it is on the list
 - make the window wider on wider monitors
 - Correct craft renaming (make sure tags are properly written)
 - If craft name in settings file is incorrect then correct it automatically
 - Correct bug that settings are marked as dirty in each frame
 - Solve problem with overlap labels
 - Solve problem with accident part clicks when window is hidden
 - Allow to Scale UI
 - Correct display of group names on craft list
 - when existing ship is saved with changed name the tags should be saved as well
 - automatically deselect <none> when any other tag is selected + the other way round
 - Show "The filter is applied [clear]" instead of current message & behaviour
 


 
Cancelled or far future:
 - Store craft history?
 - Display craft history?
 - Load crafts asynchronously?
 
 - check EditorTooltip.Instance.enabled
 - Add possibility to edit default tags
 - Highlights categories that do filter crafts
 - Add option to collapse/uncollapse all tags groups
 - Add help button to "manage tags"
 - Add button "+" inside craft that will add tag in a given category
 - Add button "+" inside craft that will add tag in any category
 - Add button "x" next to each tag in craft that will remove it
 - Add dropdown box for each tag that will allow it to be changed to different one in the same category
 - Add "hide" button next to each tag group + "hidden tags" in craft list
 
 
 - Regenerate craft thumbnails - very hard/impossible :(. We would need to load craft to editor, generate thumbnail and then load again old ship.
 - Create a list of non-default selected tags with possibility to clear them (show it above the craft list), like:
 	Bodies: [Eve x] [Duna x] BuildingStage: [Final x] [Clear All] [>>]
 - Add button "move to SPH"/"move to VAB"
 - Add non-category|hierarchical|tags
 - Create *categories
 - Cache cost/part count/etc in separate file so loading is much faster
 - Add toolbar next to category in filters: [All | Any | Single]
 - Show "Cancel & discard changes" only if some tags were actually modified
 - Allow to modify window width
 - Limit number of writes in CurrentCraftSettings window
 - Base it on plugin settings: when editor is locked the "close" should be locked as well
