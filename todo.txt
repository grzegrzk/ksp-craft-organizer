TODO:
 
 - Highlights categories that do filter crafts
 - Add option to collapse/uncollapse all tags groups
 - Add possibility to read crafts from different save
 - Add help button to "manage tags"
 - Add button "+" inside craft that will add tag in a given category
 - Add button "+" inside craft that will add tag in any category
 - Add button "x" next to each tag in craft that will remove it
 - Add dropdown box for each tag that will allow it to be changed to different one in the same category
 - Add "hide" button next to each tag group + "hidden tags" in craft list
 
Cancelled or far future:
 - Create a list of non-default selected tags with possibility to clear them (show it above the craft list), like:
 	Bodies: [Eve x] [Duna x] BuildingStage: [Final x] [Clear All] [>>]
 - Add button "move to SPH"/"move to VAB"
 - Add non-category|hierarchical|tags
 - Create *categories
 - Cache cost/part count/etc in separate file so loading is much faster
 - Add toolbar next to category in filters: [All | Any | Single]
 - Show "Cancel & discard changes" only if some tags were actually modified
 - Allow to modify window width
 - Limit number of writes in CurrentCraftSettings window
 - Base it on plugin settings: when editor is locked the "close" should be locked as well
 
 
Done:
 - Allow to collapse tags on the "manage tags" list
 - Change icons to the ones provided by cy4n
 - Add mouse over image
 - Allow to collapse tags on the filter list
 - Fix: list of crafts is not refreshed when craft is deleted
 - Fix "unsaved changes" dialog displayed when user has unmodified new craft
 - Fix bug with wrongly displayed tags in scenario: got to VAB -> open craft -> rename -> save -> assign new tags -> launch -> recover vessel -> go to VAB -> click "tags"
 - Fix bug with image sometimes displayed outside tooltip
 - Remember selected filter separately for VABinVAB/SPHinVAB/VABinSPH/SPHinSPH
 - Correct bug with tags not being saved in this scenario: open craft -> change name -> save -> go to different building using "go to" plugin
 - The tags selected in a single group should display crafts with any of the selected tags
 - Add tooltip that will show big thumbnail, name and description
 - Add double-click to load
 - Correct bug: select "all" in "-Archived?", click cancel, open window. The filter returns to default
 - Correct the way how min width is computed if there is gui scaling
 - Correct bug: open ships with tags -> change name (no save !) -> launch -> revert -> save. Bug: tags are not saved
 - Add icons to toolbar
 - Add darker background when windows are displayed
 - Remove "Edit" skin from manage window
 - Remember skin between editor opens

 - When editor is locked the "close" should be locked as well
 - add "Status\Archived" to default tags, change the prefix "Building Stage\" to "Status\"
 - In "Filter" window show tags in categories. In each category add special filtering option <with no tag from this category>
 - make changes to make it possible to have "archived" tag that will be quite natural to use
 - Load craft lazily - first load metadata if it exists (it should contain the craft name as well), then filter the crafts
 	and lastly load full craft's data only if it is on the list
 - make the window wider on wider monitors
 - Correct craft renaming (make sure tags are properly written)
