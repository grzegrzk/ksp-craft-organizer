	 * This class can generate events related to Editor: new/load/save. It can also answer if ship has been modified.
	 * 
	 * About new/load/save events:
	 * 
	 * This class can generate new/load/save events for Editor facitily. Originally Save events are not generated, so this class
	 * is a huge hack to simulate it. Basically it checks if file was updated on disk when some new ship is going to be loaded to editor
	 * or if editor is exited or if new ship is going to be made etc. This is not very reliable, but I have not found any other solution
	 * 
	 * It would be good to have following events supported nativly by KSP:
	 *  - Save event fired every time ship is saved (including autosaves), with the path to the file where it is going to be saved
	 *  - "Is ship modified" query event or similar mechanism that would allow plugin to inform the KSP that ship is modified, so
	 * 		clicking on "open" button or "new" could show warning message "your ship is not saved" even if original ship is unmodified,
	 * 		but for example tags are modified
	 * 
	 * About checking if ship has been modified:
	 * 
	 * It does not take into account that user could undo some action. It seems to be a bug in KSP that Undo events are sent 
	 * in both cases: Undo and redo, but redo are never sent so we cannot detect it reliably.
	 *
